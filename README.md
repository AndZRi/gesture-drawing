# Gesture Drawing
Basically a version of Gesture Drawing for poor (12$ for the slideshow wtf)

1. Pick a folder with images

2. Get your shuffled images slideshow with your time interval!

3. also the window is always-on-top by default

## if you have smartscreen invoked, just download the zip version
## or compile by yourself, i basically have already put everything you need

i'll do a better readme later, don't trust me
