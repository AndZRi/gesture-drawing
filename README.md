# Gesture Drawing
Basically a version of Gesture Drawing for poor (12$ for the slideshow wtf)

just unpack the archive and enjoy

I ACTUALLY FORGOT adding the always-on-top feature, but you can make so by using PowerToys (made by microsoft, installed through the microsoft store)

i'll do a readme later, believe me

i'll also add some features like skipping and pausing later
