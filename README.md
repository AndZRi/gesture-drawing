# Gesture Drawing
Basically a version of Gesture Drawing for poor (12$ for the slideshow wtf)

1. Pick a folder with images

2. Get your shuffled images slideshow with your time interval!

## it does invoke smartscreen defender because of the --onefile parameter of pyinstaller, don't worry
## you can check it via https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload
## if you are really afraid of it, you can compile the program by yourself

i'll do a readme later, believe me

i'll also add some features like skipping and pausing later
