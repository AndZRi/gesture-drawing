# Gesture Drawing
Basically a version of Gesture Drawing for poor (12$ for the slideshow wtf)

## it does invoke smartscreen defender because the test images are hidden now, don't worry
## if you are really afraid of it, you can compile the program by yourself
WHY DOES IT INVOKE SMARTSCREEN THIS IS SO STUPID

i'll do a readme later, believe me

i'll also add some features like skipping and pausing later
